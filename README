utlSolidBase.C
SolMRPCStrip.C
SolMRPCdigit.C

utlSolidBase.h
SolMRPCStrip.h
SolMRPCdigit.h
SolidConst.h

auto build:
autogen.sh
configure.ac
Makefile.am

Example running macro can be found from:
macros/
run_mrpc.C

----------------------

How to build:

> mkdir build
> cd build
> ../src/autogen.sh --prefix=/where you want to install/
> make
> make install

(You may need to modify autogen.sh depending on where libtoolize is installed)

----------------------

How to run:

Set LD_LIBRARY_PATH if necessary
> setenv LD_LIBRARY_PATH /where/you/install/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH (csh)
> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/where/you/install/lib  (bash)

Modify run_mrpc.C as needed.
- Set the charge threshold using SetQthreshold (unit: pC)
- Set # of events you want to process. See an example in run_mrpc.C. Modify inputs for "process" function.
#1: # of events you want to process. For all events, set it to 0.
#2: # of total generated events (used to caculate rate for BeamonTarget simulation)

> root -b
> .x run_mrpc.C("input file path/file name", "output file path/name", # of event
